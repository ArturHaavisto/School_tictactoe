# TicTacToe

</br>

## About

This was the last exercise of a java beginner course.
</br>
</br>
How it works:
</br>

- Choose a board size of 3x3 through 200x200 and how many is needed for a win.
- If board size is too large for the game window, it creates a minimap which shows the current view and player can navigate the board with wasd keys.
- Player starts allways
- The computer opponent is a self made.
- Computer opponent is not optimized well to handle much bigger sizes than 10x10
- The best and most tested options are 3x3 board size with 3 to win and 10x10 board size with 5 to win.
- The game has three endings: player wins, computer wins or it is a draw.
